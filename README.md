# Just a Passing Through Note - Presented by Seth Phat¬©

Passing Through Note (Short name: **PaTh-Note**) is a super simple note for you - passing passenger:   
- Visit
- Note
- Repeat

In the real world, that's how you use the note daily. Simple note helps, simple note is one of the life-hack tips.

## Features
- Create a Note-Space not only for you but others can visit and take a look too.
- Quick visit, quick access, quick note, quick share (maybe quick leave). Everything is quick.
- I want multiple Note-Space for my purposes => Sure, I got you fam!
- Hey, what about the custom styling for my note-space??? => Fam, that's one of my main features.
